# Railway Data Analysis Project

This project provides a visualization and analysis of railway data using R.

## Prerequisites

The following R libraries are required:

- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `randomForest`
- `lubridate`

Install the libraries using the following command in R:

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("lubridate")
OR
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "randomForest", "lubridate"))
```

### Dataset

Ensure the dataset `railway.csv` is located in the proper directory.

### Running the Code

You can run the script line-by-line or all at once by selecting the lines.
To run the script, click `Run` in the top-right corner of the script editor.

### View the Visualizations

The generated plots will appear in the `Plots` tab in RStudio. Each plot corresponds to the analysis specified in the code.
